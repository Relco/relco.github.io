When considering your component needs, RELCO offers the same commitment to high standards that we are known for throughout our business. Being a manufacturer of locomotives, we often can have the component you are looking for in our warehouse, from cores to RTOâ€™s to rebuilt components. We remanufacture all locomotive components in-house, using the most current technologies in tooling and testing, in accordance with the strictest quality assurance standards.

Our components are available as an outright purchase, unit exchange, or repair-and-return basis and are often ready for immediate delivery to you. And each remanufactured component comes with a full warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. Our quality assurance adheres to the strict requirements of the AAR quality assurance standard M-1003.
