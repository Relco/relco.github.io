Our Project Management Program is the culmination of over 50 years of experience. Using best-practice techniques and methodologies, our program has grown to be a bedrock program of the organization which produces the highest quality locomotives in the business.  Project Managers always carefully review sales related documentation prepared by Business Development.  This documentation helps the project manager understand what was sold while broadly defining both the customer’s and RELCO’s understanding while forming the basis of the project plan.  Once the project plan is complete, and all stakeholders (Customer, Business Development, and Operations) agree on its completeness and accuracy, a project Kickoff Meeting is scheduled with appropriate Operations personnel to transition knowledge.  This meeting is scheduled as near as possible to the projected in-shop date.

RELCO Locomotives shop production is based on a “Job Shop” model.  Work procedures and tests are developed by engineering and reviewed by QA. Each project is treated individually with its own manufacturing plan, detail work scope, and inspection plan.   All work performed is performed based on a production run of one.  Any nonconformance is a mandatory hold point.  Inspection, in-process review, and measurements, are all tools used to determine the root cause of the nonconformance and to plan the corrective action before work proceeds.  The work is re-inspected after corrective action to confirm conformance.

Material testing, welding, and other processes critical to quality that is performed by us and our sub-contractors will be performed by certified personnel using approved procedures. Qualification records of personnel and equipment will be maintained in a current status.

Procedures for welding, heat treating, and other processes are prepared and maintained to meet the requirements of the contract specifications, applicable codes and quality standards. These include procedures for operator qualification.

RELCO’s QAP defines the methodology for the control and calibration of tools, gauges, instruments, and other measuring and test devices used in work procedures affecting quality. All calibrated equipment is traceable back to an N.I.S.T. Standard. If no N.I.S.T. standard exists, the calibration is to generally accepted industry standards.  Calibration logs and individual certificates for each calibrated device are maintained.
