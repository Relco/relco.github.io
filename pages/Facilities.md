RELCO performs the majority of our remanufacturing and repairs at our state-of-the-art, 95-acre facility in Albia Iowa.  This facility was custom built in 2005 and designed using best practices developed over a 40-year period to handle every aspect of our business. The main locomotive shop, which is 100,000 square feet, has 5 tracks, two of which are served by a single-axle drop table. It houses 6 overhead cranes with a capacity of over 175 tons. The site has nearly 30 miles of track for locomotive run-in and testing, including a Y-turn track. The shop has a drop table, 2 raised-rail pits, as well as state-of-the-art fabrication and components rebuild areas.

The Albia site offers a direct interchange with the BNSF and CP railroads and a close interchange with the Union Pacific Railroad. Complimenting everything is our parts warehouse, in-house machine shop, fabrication shop, storage yard for multiple locomotives, and separate wet blast and paint facilities.
