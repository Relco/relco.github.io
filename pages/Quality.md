RELCO's Quality Assurance program is based on AAR M1003, Quality Systems for Production and Installation.  This program contains provisions to identify and comply with contract drawings and specifications, along with referenced codes and standards. Our employees strive for Quality.  These skilled people know about their customers and the high standards they require in the finished product. It begins with clear, detailed work instructions that define assembly and testing requirements. Training is an essential element, so that production personnel are able to do the work confidently, accurately and safely. Finally the program includes a set of procedures for inspection and testing to verify those standards.
